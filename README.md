# Nonfig for Wordpress

Nonfig has built-in support for Wordpress. You can now empower your web platforms by integrating Nonfig directly into wordpress using ShortCode API.

Nonfig will remove the need of providing access to your wordpress site. Every content and configuration would now be inside centralized workspace, yet still integrated everywhere.

# Developer

To run wordpress locally for developing the plugin, please run the following command with your local docker installation:

```
docker-compose -f stack.yml up
```

You would have wordpress running on port: `7777` and volume at `~/nonfig-wordpress` directory.

# Author

The package is maintained by Nonfig and open for public contributions.
