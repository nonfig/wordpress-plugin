Manage Configuration Changes from a single platform. Nonfig is a Software Configuration Hub and you store Your Software Changes in a Centralize Hub. Using Nonfig, it is now seamlessly easy to Store, Modify, and Control Software Configurations from a single Hub.

To use nonfig, please create an account at [Signup at Nonfig](https://www.nonfig.com). After signup, please create a "Consumer" as you would need `Application ID` and `Application Secret` to make this plugin work.

== Description ==

Nonfig is "Google Docs" for the Software Configurations. It provides a platform to store, modify and operate Software Configuration from a unified platform and a drop-in replacement for major programming languages. The configurations should not be the part of the Version Control System i.e GIT and Non-technical people should be empowered further to drive the changes.

Nonfig has built-in support for Wordpress. You can now empower your web platforms by integrating Nonfig directly into wordpress using ShortCode API. Nonfig will remove the need of providing access to your wordpress site. Every content and configuration would now be inside centralized workspace, yet still integrated everywhere.
