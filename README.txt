Nonfig is a Centralize Software Configuration Management Platform and reduces developer impact on behavioural changes of a Software feature.

== Description ==

Nonfig is a Centralize Software Configuration Management Platform and reduces developer impact on behavioural changes of a Software feature.

Nonfig is "Google Docs" for the Software Configurations. It provides a platform to store, modify and operate Software Configuration from a unified platform and a drop-in replacement for major programming languages. We firmly believe that the configurations should not be the part of the Version Control System i.e GIT and Non-technical people should be empowered further to drive the changes.

Nonfig has built-in support for Wordpress. You can now empower your web platforms by integrating Nonfig directly into wordpress using ShortCode API. Nonfig will remove the need of providing access to your wordpress site. Every content and configuration would now be inside centralized workspace, yet still integrated everywhere.
